# skulptshare
run github code in a codeskulptor-like environment


SkulptShare
(http://saibotshamtul.github.io/skulptshare/)
lets you paste/write CodeSkulptor python code (including the simplegui/simpleplot/simplemap modules) and then run it.

There is a small example python file on Github: 
(https://github.com/saibotshamtul/skulptshare/blob/gh-pages/github.py)  
If you wanted to automatically load this in SkulptShare, you can build a url by replacing "https://github.com/" with "http://saibotshamtul.github.io/skulptshare/#"   (http://saibotshamtul.github.io/skulptshare/#saibotshamtul/skulptshare/blob/gh-pages/github.py)


There is another example python file on Github, showing that you can import one github python file from another one (https://github.com/saibotshamtul/skulptshare/blob/gh-pages/default.py)
It's SkulptShare url would be: http://saibotshamtul.github.io/skulptshare/#saibotshamtul/skulptshare/blob/gh-pages/default.py
